I first filtered the data to only P’tiot Sparnatrail and then created a new variable representing hour using lubridate. After grouped by gender and age, average speed was computed using distance and average hour. The title was made bigger and the y-axis-title, speed, was made horizontal to make it easier to read. It seems that 30-year-old men and 37-year-old women are the fastest while 72-year-old men and 28-year-old women the slowest. For men, there is a general trend that as age goes up, speed goes down. But there is no such trend for women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I plotted the annual average onto a map and made it a gif, showing values from 1998-2020. I also changed end_pause to 10 to make it easier to follow. States on the west coast seem to have the highest average annual salary while states in the middle have lower. The average increases over the years in all states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Then I grouped by distributor and year to compute how many nominees for each distributor each year. The next step was to group by distributor to find the total nominees for each distributor these two years and filter to distributors who have a total of more than 50 nominees. It is clear from the plot that Netflix has the most nominees, though more distributors became more competitive in 2021. I also found it interesting that HBO Max, launched in 2020, had a great performance with more than 100 nominees in its first year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Weeks ranked No.1 is the most important variable for my focus and thus my first step was to remove songs whose week position is not 1. Then I grouped by song_id to compute the total weeks ranked No.1 for each song. y-axis was restructured to rank the songs from the longest to the shortest time. Old Town Road ranked No.1 for the longest time (almost 20 weeks), followed by One Sweet Day and Despacito for 16 weeks. The total weeks on chart (ranked top 100) is also included. Although Macarena is not in the top 3, it was on chart for the longest time. There seems to be no relationship between weeks on chart and weeks ranked No.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Because there are over 1000 races and over 800 drivers and I was trying to make a gif, I only focused on races 1-50 to not overwhelm the audience with too much information. fastestLapSpeed is the most important variable for my focus and thus my first step was to remove all missing values. I also changed it to numeric so that it was possible to create a continuous y-axis. y-axis labels were restructured as well to better present the points mostly in the middle of the graph. A scatterplot was chosen since I wanted to underscore the overall trend and clutter of points could help achieve so. From the gif, it seems that the fastest lap speeds fluctuate in different races and that drivers with id 1-50 are the most frequent players.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
