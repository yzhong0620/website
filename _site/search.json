This app allows users to choose a variable of interest and plot its CP profile under the random forest model. Values for each predictor can also be selected; these values form the specific observation for CP profile and are used to predict the probability of this loan being paid back. The blue dot on the plot represents this prediction.\r\nhttps://yunyang-zhong.shinyapps.io/shiny_cp/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
