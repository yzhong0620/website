```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

This is where I will talk about building this website.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)     # for graphing and data cleaning
library(lubridate)     # for date manipulation
library(ggthemes)      # for even more plotting themes
library(plotly)        # for the ggplotly() - basic interactivity

library(gganimate)     # for adding animation layers to ggplots
library(transformr)    # for "tweening" (gganimate)
library(gifski)        # need the library for creating gifs but don't need to load each time
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-09-07')
results <- tuesdata$results
```

```{r}
results %>% 
  filter(raceId==50) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = driverId, y = fastestLapSpeed))
```


```{r}
tidy <- results %>% 
  filter(raceId<=50 && driverId<=50) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = driverId, y = fastestLapSpeed)) +
  #theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  transition_states(raceId) +
  labs(title = "Fastest lap speed for each driver race 1-50",
       subtitle = "raceId: {closest_state}",
       y = "",
       caption = "Plot created by Yunyang Zhong, data from the Ergast API")

#anim_save("tidy.gif", tidy)
```

```{r}
#knitr::include_graphics("tidy.gif")
```
